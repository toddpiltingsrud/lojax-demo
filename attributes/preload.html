    <p>
        While you've been reading this page, lojax has queued up a request for the link below.
        When you click the link, lojax will note that it was marked for pre-loading and check the queue for it.
        If one is found, it'll grab it off the queue instead of creating a new one and attach 'then' and 'catch' callbacks to it.
    </p>

    <p>
        After the resource is requested by the user, it is immediately removed from the queue.
        So subsequent requests will execute as usual.
